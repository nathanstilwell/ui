# Color

## Primary Colors

## Neutrals

Neutral color is used for typography, backgrounds, borders, dividing lines, and other elements. Neutral color definition considers the difference between dark background and light background, while incorporating the WCAG 2.0 standard. 

### Light Neutrals

Use light neutrals as subtle backgrounds to indicate various interactive states such as hover and disabled, or simply to create secondary attention towards a component. Light neutrals can also be used as modal or card backgrounds to help group information.

### Medium Neutrals

Use mid-neutrals to create subtle depth in components such as dividers, illustrations or buttons. Avoid using mid-neutrals as background colors because there is usually not enough contrast to remain AA compliant. The mid-neutrals N-4 to N-5 can be used for subtle text and icons on light-neutral backgrounds.

 ### Dark Neutrals

Dark neutrals are very effective for creating contrast and are therefore the primary color used for typography.
