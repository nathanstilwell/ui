# Icon

Icons are visual representations of commands, objects, or common actions and are used to provide visual context and enhance usability. They should be simple, yet bold enough to grab attention. Icons should be used in a purposeful manner to maximize comprehension and reduce cognitive load when you need to call attention to a particular action, command, or section. Use them infrequently – if you’re questioning an icon’s use, it probably doesn’t need to be used at all.
